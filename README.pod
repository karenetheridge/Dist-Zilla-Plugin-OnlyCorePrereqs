=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OnlyCorePrereqs - Check that no prerequisites are declared that are not part of core

=head1 VERSION

version 0.014

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [OnlyCorePrereqs]
    starting_version = 5.010

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<[OnlyCorePrereqs]> is a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that checks at build time if
you have any declared prerequisites that are not shipped with Perl.

You can specify the first Perl version to check against, and which
prerequisite phase(s) are significant.

If the check fails, the build is aborted.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item * C<phase>

Indicates a phase to check against. Can be provided more than once; defaults
to C<configure>, C<build>, C<runtime>, C<test>.  (See L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs> for more
information about phases.)

Remember that you can use different settings for different phases by employing
this plugin twice, with different names.

=item * C<starting_version>

Indicates the first Perl version that should be checked against; any versions
earlier than this are not considered significant for the purposes of core
checks.  Defaults to the minimum version of perl declared in the distribution's
prerequisites, or C<5.005>.

There are two special values supported:

=over 4

=item * C<current> - indicates the version of Perl that you are currently running with

=item * C<latest> - indicates the most recent (stable or development) release of Perl

=back

(Note: if you wish to check against B<all> changes in core up to the very
latest Perl release, you should upgrade your L<Module::CoreList> installation.
You can guarantee you are always running the latest version with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PromptIfStale>. L<Module::CoreList> is also the mechanism used for
determining the version of the latest Perl release.)

=item * C<deprecated_ok>

A boolean flag indicating whether it is considered acceptable to depend on a
deprecated module. Defaults to 0.

=item * C<check_dual_life_versions>

=for stopwords lifed blead

A boolean flag indicating whether the specific module version available in the
C<starting_version> of perl be checked (even) if the module is dual-lifed.
Defaults to 1.

This is useful to B<unset> if you don't want to fail if you require a core module
that the user can still upgrade via the CPAN, but do want to fail if the
module is B<only> available in core.

Note that at the moment, the "is this module dual-lifed?" heuristic is not
100% reliable, as we may need to interrogate the PAUSE index to see if the
module is available outside of perl -- which can generate a false negative if
the module is upstream-blead and there was a recent release of a stable perl.
This is hopefully going to be rectified soon (when I add the necessary feature
to L<Module::CoreList>).

(For example, a prerequisite of L<Test::More> 0.88 at C<starting_version>
5.010 would fail with C<check_dual_life_versions = 1>, as the version of
L<Test::More> that shipped with that version of perl was only 0.72,
but not fail if C<check_dual_life_versions = 0>.

=item * C<skip>

The name of a module to exempt from checking. Can be used more than once.
