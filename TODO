TODO:

a variation of the dual-life check - do not allow things that have been
ejected from core -- check is_dual for the latest perl release.
needs 'ending_version' -- assume to be 'latest' - for requiring that
modules stay in core for the duration.
(actually only check the endpoints, since there is no precedent for a module leaving core and then re-entering it again.)
